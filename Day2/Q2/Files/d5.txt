Book chapter on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that can be used for good or for bad. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it is important to consider the ethical implications of its use.

Some of the ethical concerns raised by AI include:

The potential for AI to be used to create autonomous weapons systems that could kill without human intervention.
The potential for AI to be used to discriminate against certain groups of people.
The potential for AI to lead to mass unemployment as machines replace human workers.
It is important to have a public discussion about the ethical implications of AI so that we can ensure that it is used for good and not for harm.
