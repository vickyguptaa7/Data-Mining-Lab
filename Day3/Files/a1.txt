Cosine similarity is a measure of the similarity between two vectors. It is calculated by taking the dot product of the two vectors and dividing it by the product of their lengths. The cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means the vectors are orthogonal (have nothing in common) and 1 means they are identical (have the same direction).
